# Missing-Data-Techniques
In this repository I have provided the functions for different imputation techniques 

CCA- Complete case analysis, in this technique we drops the NAN values.

3M- Mean,Median and Mode , in this technique we use these Ms for imputation

End tail imputation - we use statistical method to impute missing values

Missing tag imputation - here we use tags to impute the values 

Random-sample imputation - here we take random sample of dame size as of our missing values

Here is my blog where I have talked about these techniques: http://www.datasciencenovice.com/
